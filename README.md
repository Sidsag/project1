#The Game  
Imagine Tic Tac Toe where the first player move doesn't always have the advantage.  Imagine Tic Tac Toe where the fun doesn't nearly have to end so quickly.  Now imagine Tic Tac Toe on 6 different planes like the side of a Rubik's Cube.  This is the concept behind the new  **[Tic Tac Toe Tactic!](http://watfood.github.io/project1)**

![Rubiks Cube](http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/zoom/rubix_cube.jpg)

**[Tic Tac Toe Tactic](http://watfood.github.io/project1)** brings the traditional classic game of Tic Tac Toe into the the next level by adding dimensions of gameplay boards(planes) as playing fields.  

* Goal is to take 3 cubes in a row just like traditional Tic Tac Toe
* Traditional Tic Tac Toe rules and gameplay.. **just expanded!**
* 6 sides total just like a cube(imagine playing **Tic Tac Toe on a Rubiks Cube!** 
* Player can take any square piece on the board/cube  
* Taking a square is actually taking a cube 
* Sides have the advantage of taking up 2 value positions along a corresponding side  
* Corner cubes take up 3 spaces with the adjoining planes
* Center square on board now has the least strategic value
* Cube Side controlled by key map or WASD gaming buttons

##Technologies & Concept Design
![Initial Concept Layout](https://i.imgur.com/y7pulbI.jpg)
The **[Tic Tac Toe Tactic](http://watfood.github.io/project1)** design approach begins with the traditional Tic Tac Toe game.  Originally thinking of playing Tic Tac Toe on a Rubiks Cube, the key design challenges were as follows;

* Designing the game on a 2-D layout with moves thinking in 3D & creating corresponding dependencies 
* Figuring out how to tie the spaces together where 1 value connect to there spaces and planes. Setting the spaces up as objects vs string variables.
* Visually interpreting & navigating the planes/sides.

The final design aesthetic was intended encompass all the great qualities original paper Tic Tac Toe have;

* Simple & Classic design, **anyone can play!** 
* Recognizable, no language barriers, **can play immediately, no manual required!**  
* Like original paper Tic Tac Toe, can be played anywhere, & in today's terms means any device anywhere, **desktop, mobile, & tablets!**

**[Tic Tac Toe Tactic](http://watfood.github.io/project1)** is built with the following technologies    

*  Javascript  
*  HTML  
*  CSS  
*  jQuery
